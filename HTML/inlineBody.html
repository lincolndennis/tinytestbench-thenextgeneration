        After many months in development, we are proud to unveil a brand new
        <a href="http://tinymce.com">website</a> and logo
        for TinyMCE! Most importantly we have developed a whole new documentation section of the
        website with hundreds of improvements to the content, examples and navigation.
    </p>
    <p>
        We know improving the documentation is something the community has wanted for a long time
        and we're pleased to bring this to you today. Expect to see continuous improvement to the docs
        over the coming months and if you'd like to contribute, check out the <code>tinymce-docs</code>
        repository on <a href="https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce-docs">GitHub</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        For open source developers interested in working on TinyMCE, we have moved the issue tracker to Github.
        The community forums are still available, although under the old website look-and-feel. An update to our
        forums is coming soon.

        The major change in this release is a rebuild of the core functionality for read-only content.
        The Noneditable Plugin, which exposes this functionality to developers, is now much more reliable and
        consistent across browsers. With the Noneditable Plugin, you can enable the nesting of writable and
        non-writable areas to create content "widgets" or "templates".
    </p>
    <p>
        We built three new features to highlight the improvements to read-only content: image captions, live
        media embedding and a new plugin for inserting code snippets called Code Sample.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also added a dynamic read-only mode, whereby you can switch between read-only and design mode in the
        editor. This is set using the API call <code>editor.setMode("readonly")</code> for read-only mode,
        and <code>editor.setMode("design")</code>for setting it back to design mode.
    </p>
    <p>
        We also added a simple plugin to TinyMCE that makes it easy for users to insert syntax highlighted code blocks.

        The plugin adds a new toolbar button that when clicked by the user presents a dialog box into which they can
        insert valid code that will be automatically converted into a code snippet within the editable area.
